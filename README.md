# Dinosaur_name
In this project, we construct a dinosaur name generator. This is a one to sequence model, the input will a letter or a word and the output will be a dinosaur name. The model consists of 4 layers. The first two layers are LSTM layers. The next layer is a fully connected layer. The last layer is a softmax layer.
